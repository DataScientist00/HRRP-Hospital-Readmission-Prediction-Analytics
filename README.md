HRRP-Hospital-Readmission-Prediction-Analytics

Problem Statement 
The Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) requires the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to reduce payments to Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) hospitals with excess readmissions for certain medical conditions. A readmission is defined as a patient returning to the hospital within 30 days of discharge for the same reason of the initial admission and is an indication of poor quality of initial care or care coordination following discharge from the hospital. 

In response to the HRRP, health organizations nationwide are developing protocols to limit unplanned 30-day readmissions in efforts to provide high-quality care and maintain financial viability. Efforts generally involve establishing a protocol for identifying patients currently within the hospital who are at high risk for 30-day readmissions and then proactively creating a post-discharge care plan in attempts to prevent the readmission from occurring.
