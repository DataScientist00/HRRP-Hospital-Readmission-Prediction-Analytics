HRRP-Hospital-Readmission-Prediction-Analytics

Problem Statement 
The Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 established the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP). The HRRP requires the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to reduce payments to Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) hospitals with excess readmissions for certain medical conditions, effective for discharges beginning on October 1, 2012. A readmission is defined as a patient returning to the hospital within 30 days of discharge for the same reason of the initial admission and is an indication of poor quality of initial care or care coordination following discharge from the hospital. Within the initial provisions of the HRRP, identified conditions included in the program were acute myocardial infarction (AMI), heart failure, and pneumonia. Once a hospital reaches a prescribed readmission percentage risk-adjusted for the severity of a hospital’s patient case mix, CMS will apply a penalty to the insurance payments remitted to hospitals for all Medicare and Medicaid patients ranging from 0-3%. 

In response to the HRRP, health organizations nationwide are developing protocols to limit unplanned 30-day readmissions in efforts to provide high-quality care and maintain financial viability. Efforts generally involve establishing a protocol for identifying patients currently within the hospital who are at high risk for 30-day readmissions and then proactively creating a post-discharge care plan in attempts to prevent the readmission from occurring. 

Today in the healthcare industry, there are few systematic ways to identify which patients are at high risk for readmission after they leave the hospital, and few studies have been done to determine appropriate protocols for post-discharge care plans from a readmissions reduction perspective. Clinicians have access to a variety of patient-level historical utilization and medical data within a patient’s electronic medical record while the patient is in the hospital. However, most have minimal analytics training and do not have the time to identify patients at high risk for readmission or an optimal care plan for patients of varying risk levels.
